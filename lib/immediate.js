/*
   setImmediate polyfill

   setImmediate is a usefull feature to run a callback asynchronously, as
   quickly as possible. It acts in the same way as `setTimeout(callback, 0);`,
   but setTimeout has a lower bound of a few milliseconds depending on the
   environment.

   Its counterpart, clearImmediate, is here to cancel an asynchronous call.

   setImmediate is a feature proposed by Microsoft but sadly not followed by
   other browsers.
